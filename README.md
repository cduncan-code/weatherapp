# weatherapp
A little application that I am making to refresh myself as well as practice a wide variety of skills. This is a work in progress!

This is an application that I am creating to refresh my knowledge of Java programming. I am also using it to learn new skills, such as working with Restful APIs, JSON formatting, and using GitHub.
